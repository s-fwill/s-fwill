# üëã Hi there

I'm Willian. Brazilian, married and dad of a little girl. ‚ù§Ô∏è

A technology professional with over 14 years of experience, who loves solving problems and communicating with people, and currently works as a Cloud TAM at AWS (Amazon Web Services).

I consider myself being generalist (which can also be viewed as t-shaped or multipotentialite), and have worked in activities such as Software Development, Enterprise Customer Support, and Technical Guidance.

Also, I am passionate about learning languages in a fun way (input-based, mostly by watching videos and series), currently speak three languages and intend to become a polyglot in the near future.
